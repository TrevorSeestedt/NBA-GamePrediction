# NBA Clutch Stats Integration Guide

## Overview
Clutch stats show how teams perform in close games (within 5 points in last 5 minutes). This is crucial for game predictions as it reveals which teams excel under pressure.

## Data Sources
- **Regular Season**: https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/clutch-traditional?SeasonType=Regular+Season (30 teams, 1 page)
- **Playoffs**: https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/clutch-traditional?SeasonType=Playoffs (16 teams, 1 page)

## Key Clutch Metrics

### Game Performance
- **Clutch Games (GP)**: Number of games with clutch situations
- **Clutch Wins/Losses (W/L)**: Record in clutch situations
- **Clutch Win% (WIN%)**: Win percentage in clutch situations

### Offensive Clutch Performance
- **Clutch Points (PTS)**: Average points in clutch time
- **Clutch FG% (FG%)**: Field goal percentage in clutch
- **Clutch 3P% (3P%)**: Three-point percentage in clutch
- **Clutch FT% (FT%)**: Free throw percentage in clutch

### Clutch Efficiency
- **Clutch +/- (PLUS_MINUS)**: Point differential in clutch situations
- **Clutch Assists (AST)**: Assists in clutch time
- **Clutch Turnovers (TOV)**: Turnovers in clutch time

## Database Schema

```python
team_clutch_stats = {
    'team_name': str,
    'team_id': int,
    'season_type': str,  # 'Regular Season' or 'Playoffs'
    
    # Game record in clutch situations
    'clutch_games': int,
    'clutch_wins': int,
    'clutch_losses': int,
    'clutch_win_pct': float,
    
    # Performance metrics
    'clutch_minutes': float,
    'clutch_points': float,
    'clutch_fg_pct': float,
    'clutch_3p_pct': float,
    'clutch_ft_pct': float,
    'clutch_ast': float,
    'clutch_tov': float,
    'clutch_plus_minus': float,
    
    # Calculated metrics
    'clutch_ast_to_ratio': float,
    'clutch_ts_pct': float,  # True shooting percentage
    'clutch_scoring_efficiency': float,
    
    'collected_at': datetime
}
```

## Integration Steps

### 1. Data Collection
The framework is already built in `src/advanced_api_client.py` and `src/hybrid_data_collector.py`. The clutch stats collection is Phase 5 of the hybrid collection process.

### 2. Prediction Features
Use clutch stats to enhance your prediction model:

```python
def get_clutch_features(team1_name, team2_name):
    """Get clutch performance features for matchup prediction"""
    
    # Get clutch stats for both teams
    team1_clutch = db.team_clutch_stats.find_one({
        'team_name': team1_name,
        'season_type': 'Regular Season'
    })
    
    team2_clutch = db.team_clutch_stats.find_one({
        'team_name': team2_name,
        'season_type': 'Regular Season'
    })
    
    if not team1_clutch or not team2_clutch:
        return None
    
    # Calculate clutch advantage
    clutch_features = {
        'clutch_win_pct_diff': team1_clutch['clutch_win_pct'] - team2_clutch['clutch_win_pct'],
        'clutch_plus_minus_diff': team1_clutch['clutch_plus_minus'] - team2_clutch['clutch_plus_minus'],
        'clutch_fg_pct_diff': team1_clutch['clutch_fg_pct'] - team2_clutch['clutch_fg_pct'],
        'clutch_3p_pct_diff': team1_clutch['clutch_3p_pct'] - team2_clutch['clutch_3p_pct'],
        'clutch_ast_to_ratio_diff': team1_clutch['clutch_ast_to_ratio'] - team2_clutch['clutch_ast_to_ratio']
    }
    
    return clutch_features
```

### 3. Matchup Analysis
Use clutch stats for game predictions:

```python
def analyze_clutch_matchup(team1_name, team2_name):
    """Analyze clutch performance for close game predictions"""
    
    clutch_features = get_clutch_features(team1_name, team2_name)
    
    if not clutch_features:
        return "No clutch data available"
    
    # Determine clutch advantage
    if clutch_features['clutch_win_pct_diff'] > 0.1:  # 10% advantage
        clutch_favorite = team1_name
        advantage = "Strong"
    elif clutch_features['clutch_win_pct_diff'] > 0.05:  # 5% advantage
        clutch_favorite = team1_name
        advantage = "Moderate"
    elif clutch_features['clutch_win_pct_diff'] < -0.1:
        clutch_favorite = team2_name
        advantage = "Strong"
    elif clutch_features['clutch_win_pct_diff'] < -0.05:
        clutch_favorite = team2_name
        advantage = "Moderate"
    else:
        clutch_favorite = "Even"
        advantage = "Minimal"
    
    analysis = {
        'clutch_favorite': clutch_favorite,
        'advantage_level': advantage,
        'win_pct_diff': clutch_features['clutch_win_pct_diff'],
        'plus_minus_diff': clutch_features['clutch_plus_minus_diff'],
        'recommendation': f"If game is close, favor {clutch_favorite}" if clutch_favorite != "Even" else "No clutch advantage"
    }
    
    return analysis
```

## Prediction Model Integration

### 4. Feature Engineering
Add clutch features to your ML model:

```python
def create_clutch_features(team1_stats, team2_stats):
    """Create clutch-based features for ML model"""
    
    features = []
    
    # Direct clutch metrics
    features.extend([
        team1_stats['clutch_win_pct'],
        team2_stats['clutch_win_pct'],
        team1_stats['clutch_plus_minus'],
        team2_stats['clutch_plus_minus'],
        team1_stats['clutch_fg_pct'],
        team2_stats['clutch_fg_pct']
    ])
    
    # Clutch differentials
    features.extend([
        team1_stats['clutch_win_pct'] - team2_stats['clutch_win_pct'],
        team1_stats['clutch_plus_minus'] - team2_stats['clutch_plus_minus'],
        team1_stats['clutch_fg_pct'] - team2_stats['clutch_fg_pct']
    ])
    
    # Clutch consistency (lower is better for turnovers)
    features.extend([
        team1_stats['clutch_ast_to_ratio'],
        team2_stats['clutch_ast_to_ratio']
    ])
    
    return features
```

### 5. Game Situation Weighting
Weight clutch stats based on game context:

```python
def get_clutch_weight(predicted_margin):
    """Weight clutch stats based on predicted game closeness"""
    
    if abs(predicted_margin) <= 3:  # Very close game
        return 0.3  # High weight for clutch stats
    elif abs(predicted_margin) <= 7:  # Moderately close
        return 0.15  # Medium weight
    else:  # Blowout likely
        return 0.05  # Low weight
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Close Game Prediction
```python
# Lakers vs Warriors - predicted to be close
clutch_analysis = analyze_clutch_matchup("Los Angeles Lakers", "Golden State Warriors")
print(f"Clutch Favorite: {clutch_analysis['clutch_favorite']}")
print(f"Advantage: {clutch_analysis['advantage_level']}")
print(f"Recommendation: {clutch_analysis['recommendation']}")
```

### Example 2: Playoff Clutch Performance
```python
# Use playoff clutch stats for playoff predictions
playoff_clutch = db.team_clutch_stats.find({
    'season_type': 'Playoffs'
}).sort('clutch_win_pct', -1)

print("Top Playoff Clutch Performers:")
for team in playoff_clutch[:5]:
    print(f"{team['team_name']}: {team['clutch_win_pct']:.1%} in clutch situations")
```

## Current Status

✅ **Framework Built**: Clutch stats collection is implemented in the hybrid data collector
✅ **Database Schema**: Ready to store clutch performance data
✅ **URLs Confirmed**: NBA.com clutch stats pages are accessible
⚠️ **Data Extraction**: Needs JavaScript rendering for full data extraction

## Next Steps

1. **Manual Data Entry**: For immediate use, manually enter clutch stats from NBA.com
2. **Selenium Integration**: Add browser automation for JavaScript-heavy pages
3. **API Alternative**: Research if NBA API has clutch stats endpoints
4. **Validation**: Test clutch predictions against actual game outcomes

## Clutch Stats Impact on Predictions

### High Impact Scenarios
- **Close Games**: Clutch stats are most predictive in games decided by ≤5 points
- **Playoff Games**: Clutch performance often determines playoff series
- **Fourth Quarter**: Teams with good clutch stats perform better in close fourth quarters

### Integration Priority
1. **Immediate**: Use clutch win% and +/- for close game predictions
2. **Medium**: Add clutch shooting percentages for offensive predictions
3. **Advanced**: Create clutch momentum indicators based on recent clutch performance

This framework provides a complete foundation for integrating clutch performance into your NBA prediction system!
